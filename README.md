This repository aims to store the code and the data used for the Functional analysis and multi-omics integration of the effect caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 at the olfactory level.

# RNA_Seq_Analysis.R
This script has been used for the analysis of differentially expressed genes in control-GFP and S-GFP conditions (mice expressing protein S (Spike) in olfactory bulb cells). The Deseq2 package has been used for this purpose, introducing the raw data from the RNA-Seq counts, as the package itself carries out the normalisation of the data.

# Proteomic_Analysis.R
Script for the analysis of proteomics data from MS/MS experiments. Differentially expressed proteins (up-regulated and down-regulated) have been studied and plotted.

# Data
In the data folder it can find the data needed to run the scripts and also the results of the scripts, such as differentially expressed genes and proteins, once run.
